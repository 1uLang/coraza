Welcome to Coraza Web Application Firewall, this project is an enterprise grade, Golang port of ModSecurity, flexible and powerful enough to serve as the baseline for many projects.

## Prerequisites

* Linux distribution (Debian and Centos are recommended, Windows is not supported yet)
* Golang compiler v1.16+


## Migrate from v1

* Rollback SecAuditLog to the legacy syntax (serial/concurrent)
* Attach an error log handler using ```waf.SetErrorLogCb(cb)``` (optional)
* If you are using @detectXSS and @detectSQLi (CRS) install the plugin [github.com/jptosso/coraza-libinjection](https://github.com/jptosso/coraza-libinjection)
* If you are using @rx with libpcre (CRS) install the plugin [github.com/jptosso/coraza-pcre](https://github.com/jptosso/coraza-pcre)
* If you are using low level APIs check the complete changelog as most of them were removed


## Running the tests

Run the go tests:

```sh
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
```

## Coraza v2 differences with v1

* Full internal API refactor, public API has not changed
* Full audit engine refactor with plugins support
* New enhanced plugins interface for transformations, actions, body processors and operators
* Now we are fully compliant with Seclang from modsecurity v2
* Many features removed and transformed into plugins: XML processing, PCRE regex, Libinjection (@detectXSS and @detectSQLi)
* Better debug logging
* New error logging (like modsecurity)

## Your first Coraza WAF project

```go
package main
import(
	"fmt"
	"github.com/jptosso/coraza-waf/v2"
	"github.com/jptosso/coraza-waf/v2/seclang"
)

func main() {
	// First we initialize our waf and our seclang parser
	waf := coraza.NewWaf()
	parser := seclang.NewParser(waf)

	// Now we parse our rules
	parser.FromString(`SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@rx .*" "id:1,phase:1,drop"`)

	// Then we create a transaction and assign some variables
	tx := waf.NewTransaction()
	tx.ProcessConnection("127.0.0.1", 8080, "127.0.0.1", 12345)

	tx.ProcessRequestHeaders()

	// Finally we check the transaction status
	if tx.Interrupted() {
		fmt.Println("Transaction was interrupted")
	}
}
```

### Integrate with any framework

Using the standard net/http library:

```go
package main
import(
	"github.com/jptosso/coraza-waf/v2"
	"github.com/jptosso/coraza-waf/v2/seclang"
	"net/http"
)

func SomeErrorPage(w http.ResponseWriter) {
	w.WriteHeader(403)
	w.Write([]byte("WAF ERROR")
}

func someHandler(waf *engine.Waf) http.Handler {
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    tx := waf.NewTransaction()
	tx.ProcessRequest(r)
	if tx.Interruption != nil {
		SomeErrorPage(w)
	}
  })
}
```

## Why Coraza WAF?

### Philosophy

* **Simplicity:** Anyone should be able to understand and modify Coraza WAF's source code
* **Extensibility:** It should be easy to extend Coraza WAF with new functionalities
* **Innovation:** Coraza WAF isn't just a ModSecurity port, it must include awesome new functions (in the meantime it's just a port :sweat_smile:)
* **Community:** Coraza WAF is a community project and everyone's idea will be heard

### Plugins roadmap

* WASM scripts support
* Lua script support
* Integrated DDOS protection and directives with iptables(And others) integration
* Integrated protocol validations ([rfc2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616)) (maybe)
* Integrated CSRF protection (maybe)
* Integrated bot detection with captcha
* Open Policy Agent package (OPA)
* Native antivirus integration (maybe)
* Automatic coreruleset integration (download and setup) (maybe)
* Enhanced data signing features (cookies, forms, etc)
* OpenAPI enforcement
* JWT enforcement
* XML request body processor
* Libinjection integration
* Lib PCRE integration
* Bluemonday policies
